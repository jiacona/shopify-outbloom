In his fascinating book \"How bad are Bananas?\" Mike Berners-Lee investigates the carbon cost of supermarket flowers. He found that out-of-season cut flowers were some of the highest carbon cost things you can buy. <\/p><p>Out of season flowers are either imported from somewhere warm, or grown with added heat and light. If they are grown somewhere warm (in Europe, flowers often come from Kenya) they come in by airplane. If they are grown in Europe, they have to be grown indoors with artificial heat and light. <\/p><p><strong>What we do differently<\/strong><\/p><p>Our flowers are all grown in their season. We do grow in a polytunnel to extend the season a bit, but never use added heat or light. This means our flowers get to you at a tiny fraction of the carbon cost of supermarket blooms. We also use solar on the farm and deliver in an electric van (often powered by our own solar). This reduces the carbon cost even further.<\/p>",

We try to build up an ecosystem of life that our flowers fit into. We start by building healthy soil that is full of life. This is the foundation for everything else. We add lots of compost and grow cover crops to build fertility. We minimising tilling and digging to allow the soil ecosystem to remain intact. We encourage beneficial insects and predators by providing lots of verges and habitat.<\/p><p>The growing site itself sits in a larger plot that we are managing to be a nice place for wildlife to live. We are planting native woodland and are aiming for a mosaic of woodland and species rich meadows.  We'd love for our farm to be a positive example of a productive farm that is also home to all sorts of other life. <\/p>",
